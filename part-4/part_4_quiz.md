What is the main difference between == and === in JavaScript?
== checks whether the value of two statements is equal, whereas === checks whether
both the value and the type are equal; in other words, 5 == '5' would equate to
true, whereas 5 === '5' would equate to false, because when using ===, JavaScript
checks for type value as well, and an integer is not a string.
